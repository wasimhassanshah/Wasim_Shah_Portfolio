# [Project 1: House Price Predictor : Project Overview](https://github.com/wasimhassanshah/Predicting-House-Prices-in-Python)
* Applied the Machine Laerning Algorithms : Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression to predict House prices 
* After Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering is done to extract useful features to improve the accuracy of the model
* Significant features are used to train the linear regression model, and the best model is selected accordingly.
* Hyperparameter tunning is done on Decision Tree Regressor to find optimal parameters for the model using RandomSearchCV
* Optimal parameters are used to reach the best Decision Tree Regressor model
* Out of two selected models of Linear Regression and of Decision Tree Regreesor, the best performing model is found to be of a Decision Tree Regressor.

## [Project 2: Customer-Segmentation-Kmeans-Clustering](https://github.com/wasimhassanshah/Customer-Segmentation-Kmeans-Clustering)
* Performed an exploratory analysis on the dataset.
* Applied Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction
* Applied K-means clustering algorithm in order to segment customers.
* Customer Segmentation : Dividing customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits.
